# CDSS_final-project
Using Electromyogram (EMG) For Prosthetic Fingers Control
## In this repo we added all the notebooks that include processing and modeling the EMG records.
### we divided the processing  for ***4*** cases 
1. All data 
2. The whole record
3. Seperate windows of the record
4. overlaped windows 
### First of all notebook for visualization of data and extraction of features for whole record.
### You will find 2 notebooks per each case:
*Note: the whole record have 3 notebooks because we used 2 methods for selection and 2 for classification in seprate notebooks* 
1. one for feature extraction and selection and dimentionalty reduction 
2. For different classifiers and precision score.
